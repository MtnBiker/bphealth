Trying to get bloodpressure app working with Rails 7.0.0.

âžœ rails new rails700c --database=postgresql --css bootstrap

But got esbuild by default.

Going to copy in bloodpressure

Brought in some error handling and annotating gems

Needed to add
    "build:css": "sass ./app/assets/stylesheets/application.bootstrap.scss ./app/assets/builds/application.css --no-source-map --load-path=node_modules"
to package.json. But I need to find out how to have this added

Table is loading. Charts are not. Import is (still can't grab location.)

All working in 7.0.0 which I couldn't make happen in original app. Still need to grap location of export.zip
