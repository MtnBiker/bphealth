<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
  <input  type="text" id="qty" name="qty" class="input">
  <input  type="text" id="discount" name="discount" class="input">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

The example is for a  form submits/validations to work which is less complicated than what I'm looking for
